                <p class="case-study__section-text">
                    Before diving into solutions, we needed to understand the landscape. Clay, the founder of Guild Gaming, was building a platform for gaming event organizers. To support this vision, we conducted extensive user research to uncover the real and often overlooked challenges organizers face after their tournaments end.
                    <br /><br />
                    One theme quickly emerged: <strong>making sense of data post-event is critical.</strong> Event Organizers rely on data to understand whether their event was a success or a failure, both financially and in terms of reach.

                    How many people watched, and how many followers did we gain on Twitch or Twitter?<span class="quote-mark">"</span><br />

                    Event organizers, many of whom lack the expertise to interpret data visualizations, often struggle to make sense of their post-event analytics. This leads to missed opportunities when planning future events.

                    Rather than reinventing the wheel, we analyzed how AI is applied both within data visualization tools and beyond, drawing inspiration from platforms like Notion, SunDial, and Glean. We examined their use of AI and design patterns to inform our own approach which we will dive into in the next section.

                <p class="case-study__section-text">
                    Typically, after an event, organizers manually create reports to share with stakeholders, highlighting metrics such as revenue generated, audience engagement, or drops in viewership on platforms like Twitter. However, this process often involves analyzing fragmented data and playing a guessing game to piece together insights. The result? <strong>Reports that lack depth, clarity, and confidence.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="case-study__section-text case-study__section-text--spaced-question">
                    That's when we asked: <strong><em>What if AI could simplify and elevate this process?</em></strong>

                        Using the gaming communities around Texas, we conducted a survey to understand the current post-event workflow of event organizers who have experience organizing tournaments in their various cities in TX.

                        The key takeaway from our user research is that users prioritize efficiency, automated workflows, and simplicity. With these insights in mind, the main goal was <strong>to design a dashboard that leverages AI in assisting users by quickly deriving insights from analytical graphs.</strong>

                    <strong>What I learned: </strong> This project was both exciting and educational as it deepened my understanding of AI's potential in analytics and reinforced the importance of staying up to date with emerging use cases that enhance user experiences. It also highlighted how crucial it is to design with our users' needs while considering their level of tech savviness, as neglecting this could result in a challenging learning curve for them.
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>Next Steps: </strong> The Product team looked into the possibility of both launching and beta testing the product to a target audience, but unfortunately, after our conversation with the stakeholders, they would not be moving forward with the direction of utilizing the dashboard. 
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>What I'm Proud of: </strong>I am most proud of all the work that we were able to achieve within quite a short period, and I believe that with more time, we could have developed a much more valuable product for our users and assessed its usability and desirability.
